Hello!

This is a projects i like so much and it represents a page of an online-cinema (which is unreal ofc).

Pure HTML, CSS, and a couple of JS-functions like current time/date, blinking dots between them, 
and try to click on buttoms to watch trailers!! (it opens modal windows with youtube videos)

Hope you like this, thanks!!!
